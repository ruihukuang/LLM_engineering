## day 3  

Context  

Use the following models to tokenize input messages.  

meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B 
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct  
microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct  
Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct  
bigcode/starcoder2-3b  


## day 4  

Context 

Use the following models to tokenize input messages and then to use system/user messages to ask these models to tell a light-heared joke for data scientists.  

meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct  
microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct 
google/gemma-2-2b-it 

In addition, quantization Config enables deployment of larger models on smaller hardware, dramatically reducing infrastructure costs.    

Screenshots below show outputs.
